# Machine Learning Project: Candidate's Acceptance Rate Prediction
Hi!

This repository contains the code and resources for the Recruitment Project Sample, which aims to predict candidate's acceptance rate based on various input from the user.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can address recruitment problem using supervised learning

I obtain the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predicting-hiring-decisions-in-recruitment-data/data


Data Visualization can also be seen here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/cdca5533-3e71-488b-b16c-8588fbffddec

## Results
Model Accuracy: [90,6%]

Precision: [86,3%]

Recall: [82,6%]
